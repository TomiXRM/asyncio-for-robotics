# Using Scope

> [!NOTE]
> Scopes are optional, but strongly recommended. Long-running asyncio tasks,
> subscriptions, and helper threads are not garbage collected by Python.

`afor.Scope` is the normal lifetime owner for active `afor` objects.

Inside a scope block:

- new `afor` objects join the current scope automatically
- leaving the block closes them
- internal failures propagate out of the block
- `afor.Scope.current()` returns the current, active scope.
- `raise afor.ScopeBreak()` exits the current scope now
- `scope.cancel()` requests teardown of a scope without changing local control flow
- `scope.finished` reports how a scope ended once teardown is done

This keeps ownership visible without forcing the user to attach every object one by one.

Typical use:

```python
import asyncio_for_robotics as afor


async with afor.Scope():
    sub = afor.ros2.Sub(String, "/chatter")
    client = afor.ros2.Client(MySrv, "/compute")
    current_scope = afor.Scope.current()
    timer = afor.Rate(10, scope=current_scope)
```

All three objects belong to the same lexical lifetime. Leaving the block closes
them automatically and releases all of their ressources (ROS 2 subscriptions,
client, server; Zenoh sub ...).

> [!WARNING]
> Scopes do not support Python 3.10 or earlier. They rely on asyncio.TaskGroup
> and other modern asyncio features that are incomplete or unavailable on
> Python 3.10.
> 
> We strongly recommend Python 3.11 or newer. Our support for Python 3.10 may be
> dropped in the future if it continues to create maintenance problems.


## `@afor.scoped`

Use `@afor.scoped` to quicly scope a function.

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_for_robotics as afor


@afor.scoped
async def main():
    sub = afor.BaseSub[str]()
    sub.input_data("hello")
    print(await sub.wait_for_value())


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Different from `asyncio.TaskGroup`

`afor.Scope` is lexical lifetime ownership, not a task nursery.

When execution reaches the end of the `async with afor.Scope():` block, the
scope exits normally and closes the objects it owns, even if those objects are
designed to run forever.
This is different from `TaskGroup`, where normal block exit means "wait for
child tasks to complete".

If you want a scope to stay alive until something else stops it, write that
explicitly:

```python
async def main():
    async with afor.Scope():
        sub = afor.BaseSub[str]()
        await asyncio.Future()
```

# Advanced use:

## Deferred attach

Use this only when construction and ownership need to happen at different times.

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_for_robotics as afor


async def main():
    sub = afor.BaseSub[str](scope=None)

    async with afor.Scope() as scope:
        sub.attach(scope)
        sub.input_data("late-binding")
        value = await sub.wait_for_value()
        print(value)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Exiting the current scope

Use `raise afor.ScopeBreak()` when you want to leave the current scope now and continue after the block.

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_for_robotics as afor


async def main():
    async with afor.Scope():
        sub = afor.BaseSub[str]()
        sub.input_data("hello")
        raise afor.ScopeBreak()
        print("I won't print")

    print("continues here")


asyncio.run(main())
```

This is the closest thing to a `break` for a scope.

## Cancelling a scope

`scope.cancel()` requests early stop of the scope. This is useful when your
subscriptions are long-lived and you want the scope to tear down instead of
waiting for a natural end condition. `scope.cancel()` does not change the local
control flow of the current block. It requests teardown of that scope, but it
does not mean "leave this block right now".

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_for_robotics as afor


async def main():
    async with afor.Scope() as scope:
        sub = afor.BaseSub[str]()
        scope.cancel()
        await asyncio.sleep(0)
        print("I will print")

    await sub.lifetime
    print("scope stopped cleanly")


asyncio.run(main())
```


## Observing scope end

`scope.finished` is a future resolved when scope teardown is complete.
Use the future state directly:

- running: `not scope.finished.done()`
- completed normally: `scope.finished.done()` and `scope.finished.exception() is None`
- cancelled: `scope.finished.cancelled()`
- failed: `scope.finished.exception()` returns the propagated error

Example:

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_for_robotics as afor


async def worker(scope: afor.Scope):
    await scope.finished
    print("completed")


async def main():
    async with afor.Scope() as outer:
        scope = afor.Scope()
        assert outer.task_group is not None
        outer.task_group.create_task(worker(scope))
        async with scope:
            sub = afor.BaseSub[str]()
            sub.input_data("hello")
            await sub.wait_for_value()


asyncio.run(main())
```

`scope.finished` is mainly for observers.
Awaiting it from inside the same still-running scope body is usually not useful unless some other task is responsible for ending that scope.

Calling `scope.finished.cancel()` while the scope is still running requests cancellation of that scope.

## Failure propagation

If a scoped subscriber fails internally, the scope fails too.
Because `Scope` uses `TaskGroup`, the propagated error may be a task-group exception group rather than the raw inner exception.

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_for_robotics as afor


async def main():
    try:
        async with afor.Scope():
            sub = afor.BaseSub[str]()

            def boom(_: str) -> None:
                raise RuntimeError("boom")

            sub.asap_callback.append(boom)
            sub.input_data("hello")
            await asyncio.sleep(0)
    except Exception as exc:
        print(f"scope failed: {exc}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Notes

- `close()` is for one object.
- `raise afor.ScopeBreak()` exits the current scope now.
- `cancel()` requests teardown of a scope without acting like a local `break`.
- `finished` exposes normal `asyncio.Future` state for scope completion.
- `@afor.scoped` wraps an async function in a scope.
- `attach(scope)` is advanced API.
- `scope.task_group` exposes the real `TaskGroup`.
- `scope.exit_stack` exposes the real `AsyncExitStack`.

For a concrete advanced example, see
[`ros2_double_talker.py`](./asyncio_for_robotics/example/ros2_double_talker.py).
That example shows three advanced patterns together:
- the outer scope uses `scope.task_group` to own long-lived publisher tasks
- each publisher loop has its own `@afor.scoped` lifetime
- each inner scope uses `scope.exit_stack` to register teardown of a native
  ROS publisher so it is destroyed automatically when that publisher scope
  exits
